# Cosmic Exploration Books

Exploration Books are Jupyter Notebooks designed to teach physics, scientific methods, and introductory programming and data skills using QuarkNet's cosmic ray muon data.  Notebooks are based on the [Cosmic Ray e-Lab](https://www.i2u2.org/elab/cosmic/home/project.jsp) analysis algorithms and incorporate the Python [Parsl parallel-scripting](http://parsl-project.org/) library to illustrate and facilitate the data workflow. 

The Exploration Books are organized into sets that correspond to each of the Cosmic Ray e-Lab studies.  'Exploration_Flux', for example, first steps the user through the five individual scripts of the Flux Study - WireDelay, Combine, SingleChannel, Sort, and Flux - and then unites these in the Flux_Study notebook.  This final notebook shows the user how the previous workflow scripts, taken as a whole, transforms raw cosmic ray data into the results generated by the Flux Study analysis.

The Exploration Books can be previewed on GitHub, but using them interactively as intended is best done through Binder or Colab. The notebook ExplorationBooks/Exploration_Flux/1_WireDelay_script.ipynb, for example, can be accessed as

in Binder or

in Colab.
