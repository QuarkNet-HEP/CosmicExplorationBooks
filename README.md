# Cosmic Exploration Books

Jupyter Notebooks designed to teach physics, scientific methods, and introductory programming and data skills using QuarkNet's cosmic ray muon data.  Notebooks are based on the Cosmic Ray e-Lab analysis algorithms and incorporate the Python [Parsl parallel-scripting](http://parsl-project.org/) library to illustrate and facilitate the data workflow.
