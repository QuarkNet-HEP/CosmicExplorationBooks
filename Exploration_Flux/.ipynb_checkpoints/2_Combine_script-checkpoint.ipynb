And since neutrinos are uncharged, the scintillator material in these experiments does not respond to them directly, but rather to the charged particles (electrons and sometimes muons) that are \"kicked out\" on those rare occasions when a neutrino does interact with the nucleus of an atom of scintillator.\n",

When a cosmic ray muon passes through the tank, it will trigger CRMDs on both the top and bottom of the tank in rapid succession - almost instantaneously, in fact, since the muons are travelling close to the speed of light.  Particle tracks that originate within the tank, however, won't ever activate detectors on both sides of the tank at once.  This means that we can use software or electronic hardware to look for two closely-spaced CRMD events and prevent any signal in the detector tank from being recorded when that happens.  This rejection of bad data before it can be recorded is called a **veto**."

    "The line count looks like what we expect for combining two files of 4424 lines and 7776 lines, respectively.  However, there's one other aspect of this output we might not have expected.  Whenever we've looked at `.thresh` cosmic ray data files before, all of the data has been in chronological order with the earliest muon hits at the beginning and the latest ones at the end.  In the case of this output file, `combineOut-05072017`, though, all of the detector 6148 data is at the beginning of the file, and all of the detector 6478 data is at the end of the file, even though data from the two detectors overlapped in time.  This means that the data can't possibly be in chronological order any more!"

Re-arranging the lines of data to put them in order of time is a separate data transformation handled by a separate script; we'll examine that one soon enough."
